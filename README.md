# Minkowski_Diagram

Welcome! 

This module gives the Minkowski space-time diagram for an event. 

Event A happens at t = 0 , d = 0 as reference. 

The user specifies the Event B coordinates in an inertial frame, and the velocity of the moving frame as a fraction of c (e.g. 0.3c, fixed along the x-axis). 
A lorentz transformation gives the moving frame axes and the primed coordinates of Event B. 

For this illustration, we set speed of light c = 1.

Visualizing Examples 

"Time Dilation"

We set d = 0, t = 3, v = 0.5c

t_prime > t

A moving observer would remark that time passes slower for the non-moving observer.  


"Relative nature of simultaneity"

We set d = 5, t = 0, v =0.5

Non-moving observer sees Events A and B happen simultaneously, but for moving observer Event B happens before event A!
